# OME Bug

## OME Version

3.7.0 (Build 82)

## Description

OME Does not correctly handle the @odata.nextLink attribute for /api/DeviceService/Devices when passed specific IDs. For example:

https://10.55.160.130/api/DeviceService/Devices?Id=13878,16669,16697,16698,16700,16701,16705,16707,16711,16712,16803,16846,16852,16975,16976,16982,16983,17002,17006,17007,17008,17020,17021,17255,17288,17289,17750,17752,17753,17755,17780,17781,17821,17822,17824,17825,17826,17829,17834,17835,17836,17838,17847,17848,17850,17851,17852,17856,17857,17864,17865,17868,17869,17870,17892,17893,17895,17896,17897,17902,17903,17904,17924,17934,17956,17970,17971,17992,18016,18017,18021,18023,18027,18075,18167,18417,18418,18419,18420,18421,18422,18423,18442,18443,18444,18445,18446,18447,18448,18449,18450,18451,18452,18453,18454,18455,18456,18457,18458,18459,18460,18461,18462,18463,18464,18465,18466,18467,18468,18469,18470,18471,18472,18473,18474,18475,18476,18477,18478,18479,18480,18481,18482,18483,18484,18485,18486,18487,18488,18489,18490,18491,18492,18493,18494,18495,18496,18497,18498,18499,18500,18501,18502,18503,18504,18505,18506,18507,18509,18510,18511,18512,18513,18514

The first page of 50 results works as expected. However, after retrieval of the first set of 50 machines the nextLink url is trunkated to '/api/DeviceService/Devices?$skip=50&$top=50' instead of properly including the IDs listed in the original URL. This leads to automated code looping over the totality of the OME inventory instead of some list of specified IDs.
