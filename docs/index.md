# Grant Curell's Dell Projects

Every time Dell asks me to figure something out, I write it down. Mostly because more often than not someone asks me about it a year later and I have to remember what I did.

## Questions

If you have any questions about something I did, open an issue on the repo at https://github.com/grantcurell/grantcurell.github.io and I'll respond.

## Site Bugs

I built this 15 December and there's a few folders that are broken. I'll fix them.
