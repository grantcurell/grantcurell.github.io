## How NVMe Drive Opcodes Work

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19006632/how-is-a-pci-pcie-bar-size-determined

- BIOS/OS discovers whether PCIe device exists
- Places the addresses for mmio or I/O port addresses in NVMe driveâ€‹'s BAR registers (which it figures out from the configuration registers)
- It seems from the documentation I found NVMe does this through 64bit mmio
- Driver establishes the admin queue via BAR0. The admin queue's base addresses are in ASQ and ACQ respectively
- I submit commands to the admin submission queue to establish I/O queues.
- Send/receive data via I/O queues.

## PCIe Bridge vs Switch

With good ol' PCI, a single bus can have many devices. A PCI bridge
is a device that connects multiple buses together, which is something
that was very seldom needed.

PCI Express looks, for software, very similar to PCI, but is electrically
a point-to-point connection, i.e., a PCIe bus has exactly two devices.

To connect PCIe with PCI, you need a PCI/PCIe or PCIe/PCI bridge.

If you have a single PCIe connector and multiple PCIe devices, you need
a PCIe switch. A single PCIe connection still is between exactly two
devices, so a PCIe switch consists of a (virtual) PCI bridge for the
upstream PCIe connection, and one (virtual) PCI bridge for each
downstream PCIe connection.

## How to Check CPU Affinity

```
[root@r7525 ~]# cat /sys/class/pci_bus/0000\:00/cpulistaffinity
24-31,88-95
[root@r7525 ~]# lscpu | grep -i numa
NUMA node(s):        8
NUMA node0 CPU(s):   0-7,64-71
NUMA node1 CPU(s):   8-15,72-79
NUMA node2 CPU(s):   16-23,80-87
NUMA node3 CPU(s):   24-31,88-95
NUMA node4 CPU(s):   32-39,96-103
NUMA node5 CPU(s):   40-47,104-111
NUMA node6 CPU(s):   48-55,112-119
NUMA node7 CPU(s):   56-63,120-127
```
You can check the CPU affinity of a PCIe bus and then see what processor it is aligned to by referencing the processor ranges.
