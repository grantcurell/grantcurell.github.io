## Redeploying VxRail Manager

If VxRail Manager was previously deployed but something happened to it you can rebuild it. If you have the old VxRail manager, but the cluster has changed on ESXi, you will have to do:

- Update `/var/lib/vmware-marvin/runtime.properties` with the new cluster UUID
- Connect to the postgresql database on the manager, go to the settings table and update it with the new settings.

If you are redeploying VxRail manager in its totality then you can follow this procedure: [reloading-vxrail-plugin.docx](./reloading-vxrail-plugin.docx)
