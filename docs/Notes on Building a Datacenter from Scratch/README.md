## Power

- Typically, the total power supplied to the Data Center should be two times or more than the total power required by the IT equipment (including future Loads). The other half will be consumed by the cooling and other facilities.
- Power is usually measured in Watts (W). Each piece of IT equipment has a specific Wattage, or Power Rating, specifying the amount of Power it consumes. The total sum of Power Ratings of all IT equipment running in the Data Center gives the total IT Load of the Data Center.
  - IT Load, or Critical Load, is the total Power consumed by all critical IT equipment in the Data Center.
  - Most manufacturer specified power requirements for IT equipment are usually over-stated. Actual consumption typically does not exceed 70% of stated value. A good practice is to de-rate stated values by 60 â€“ 70% before computing total IT Load
  - Industry best practice is to allocate 4 -5 kW per rack. (TODO - still current in 2022?)

### Rough Flow of Power

- Utility Supply
- Generators
- Transfer Switches
- Distribution Panels
- Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
- PDU
