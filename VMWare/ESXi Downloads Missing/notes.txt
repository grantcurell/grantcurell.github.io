- Go to support website for vep - dropdown is missing
- Click download can't find it anymore no links
- Google "dell vep esxi"
- So you go and make a MyVMWare account.
- Is this the right image for my box? I can't tell.
	- Reasonable because you think well each box is different so I'd expect the ISOs to also be different.
- Ask support, is it the same image for everything? They don't know and since I've made custome ISOs I reason that surely they must be different

- Go to R240 - ESXi 6.7 U2 *IS* there, but ESXi 6.7U3 isn't.
- Go to 7.0 and it's missing altogether
- Click on 7.0 U1 and there is no version's tab, but on 7.0 flat there is, but it's wrong
